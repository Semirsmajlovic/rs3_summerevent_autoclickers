<h3 align="center">RS3 AFK Dungeoneering Hole - Summer Event Auto Clicker</h3>
  <p align="center">
    The script operates by listening for specific keyboard inputs to control its execution. Pressing 's' starts or stops the auto-clicking process, while pressing 'Esc' exits the script entirely. The script will drink two cocktails, and then click the dungeoneering hole, the sequence will determine when the 15 minutes are up and it will auto-click in intervals within that 15 minutes and repeat. This automation helps players avoid the tedium of manual clicking and ensures that the task is performed with consistent timing and accuracy.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This section provides instructions on how to properly run the script and start the auto clicker.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
* Python Launcher
* Python (verify installation with `python --version`)

### Installation & Usage

1. Clone the repository `git clone git@github.com:Semirsmajlovic/rs3_dunghole_potion_autoclicker_15mins.git rs3_dunghole_potion_autoclicker_15mins`.
2. Ensure that your camera is facing up and center the dungeoneering hole on screen.
3. Ensure that your layout is setup where the `Hole in One` cocktail and `Lemon Sour` cocktail are in the right positions and that the inventory tab is all the way to the right (Chat and others are not important).
4. Use the below video as an example on the setup.

5. Right-click the script and launch it using Python Launcher. Then press the key `s` in the `Command Prompt` or `Terminal`, once the script starts, you have about 5-10 seconds to ensure that you click within the RS3 window to make it the active screen.

6. If the script is properly working, you will see this in the `Command Prompt` or `Terminal` as an starting example.

7. Enjoy! This is a full AFK scripts, the mouse will be unusable as it uses the mouses pointer for clicks. This script is completely undetectable as it has numerous rotations, timer delays and random coordinate generators.
